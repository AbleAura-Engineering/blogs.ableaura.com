This is an example of plotting Edward Lorenz's 1963 "Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow" in a 3-dimensional space using mplot3d.

> Because this is a simple non-linear ODE, it would be more easily done using SciPy's ODE solver, but this approach depends only upon NumPy. 

```python
def lorenz(x, y, z, s=10, r=28, b=2.667):
    x_dot = s*(y - x)
    y_dot = r*x - y - x*z
    z_dot = x*y - b*z
    return x_dot, y_dot, z_dot
plt.show()
```

At CAMS —Consolidated Asset Mangement Services— the founding principle is to add value through superior management and operation of our clients’ infrastructure assets. However, we found an area of opportunity after observing that the company’s clients —who were asset owners— did not have access to succinct and real-time information on the financial and operational performance of individual assets.

Building the eTRAC platform
eTRAC is a CAMS proprietary software marketed as a (PaaS) —platform as a service— which provides real-time financial intelligence for energy generation assets. The goal of the platform was to effectively consolidate all the data that was being collected and have the available data visualizations at any given moment.

This was very valuable for providing insights into the data to the clients of the company, and internal Asset Managers who could use it for statistical analysis. Furthermore, our software monitored terabytes of real-time and forecasted data such as system conditions and price reports from multiple energy projects like conventional power plants, to renewable energy sources like wind farms.
